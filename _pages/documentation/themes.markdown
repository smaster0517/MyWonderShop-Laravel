FlyMyShop gives you the flexibility to change the design of your shop using themes.

When using themes you have option to use FlyMyShop functions and variables that are available to your themes to display the data as you please.

To create a new theme you can issue the artisan command

{% highlight shell %}
php artisan make:theme ThemeName
{% endhighlight %}

This will create the necessary theme files in your `public/themes/` folder.
