This part explain the current way to get new plugins and install them.

<h2>Getting new plugins and themes</h2>

As FlyMyShop does not yet has an online repository, one can obtain plugins and themes from third party providers like Github.


<h2>Installing plugins</h2>

Once you have obtained the plugin file (zip file that contains are the required plugin files) from a third party source, unzip the file and upload the file to `/flymycloud/core/flymycloud/plugins/` folder.

Then you can enable the new plugin using the admin interface.

<h2>Installing themes</h2>

Similar to the steps described above, upload the unzipped files to `/public/themes/` folder and enable the new theme using the admin interface.
