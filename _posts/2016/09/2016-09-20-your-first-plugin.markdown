Let me show you how to create your first plugin.

Once you have downloaded and installed Flymyshop, go to the folder and then

{% highlight shell %}
cd flymyshop/core
php artisan make:plugin YourPlugin
{% endhighlight %}

That's it. You have now created your first plugin! You can now add hooks to do whatever you want to do.
